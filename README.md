### IC Packaging a Semiconductor Die
• Semiconductor Die is sensitive and vulnerable to various environmental factors if not taken care will impact the functionality of IC         
• By enclosing the semiconductor die, IC packaging provides
Environmental protection
Thermal Management 
Electrical Connectivity and other benefits

1. Die Protection

2. Electrical Interconnection

3. Thermal Management
